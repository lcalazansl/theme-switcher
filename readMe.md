A **THEME SWITCHER** static website with both ***light and dark mode*** and a ***solarised option***.

I've used semantic HTML by applying elements such as `<nav>`, `<header>` and `<main>` instead of just `<div class="something">`.

I used only CSS for the dropdown on the navbar.

The header's background shape is made with `clip-path: polygon();`.

I've used CSS `--variables` to update the colours.

Media queries for responsiveness.

DOM elements and event handlers to toggle the desired option.

`localStorage` to apply the cached user's theme on refresh.
